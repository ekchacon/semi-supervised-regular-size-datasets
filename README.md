# Semi-supervised classification using two benchmark image datasets
Four methods comparison performance with few labeled datasets.

# the aim of the project

Deep learning has been succesfully employed in several domains using large amount of labeled datasets, which are carefully built and for a long time. Obtaining massive annotated datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In many areas, the lack of labeled data limits the use of deep learning as a powerful tool to resolve complex problems in real world applications. However, data with unknown labels is the way vast quantities of data exists in the real world.

The aim of this project is to asses a proposed method that leverages unlabeled data to improve model performance using few labeled examples. The method performance is also compared with other method's.
