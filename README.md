# Semi-supervised classification using two benchmark image datasets
Four methods comparison performance with few labeled datasets.

# the aim of the project

Deep learning has been succesfully employed in several domains using large amount of labeled datasets, which are carefully built and for a long time. Obtaining massive annotated datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. The lack of labeled datasets in many areas limit the use of deep learning as a powerful tool to resolve complex problems in real world applications. However, data with unknown labels is the way vast quantities of data exists in the real world.


There are many ways to deal with the scarcely available labeled examples but the use of unlabeled

The aim of this project is to asses a proposed method that use few labeled examples and leverages
